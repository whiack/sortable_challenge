I found out that there is a very high miss rate because of the
manufacturer in list.txt has family name or region in it. For example, “Sony” and “Sony Canada”. Consider the company prefer lower recall to false positives,
I decided not to consider them as same company, in case “Sony" and “Sony Canada” are different companies. Also, I decided not see "Fuji" and "Fujifilm" 
as the same company, since there might have "sony" and "sonya" as 
different companies.


How to run the code:

download the folder and run ./go.sh 
then the output will be printed to the “result.txt” file
